0. “This License” refers to version 1.c of the Raphielscape Public License.

1. “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works.

2. “The Work" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. 
   “Licensees” and “recipients” may be individuals or organizations.

3. To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, 
   other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work 
   or a work “based on” the earlier work.

4. Source Form. The “source form” for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. 
   “Object code” means any non-source form of a work.

  The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and 
  (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.
